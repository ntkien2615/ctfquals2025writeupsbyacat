This is the penguin drawing challenge ("")>

The target website is a pixel art drawing site.

Looking in ./src, it indeed uses two models: ShuffleNet V2 x2.0 and Regnet X 1.6F in the ./models directory.

The flag is split into 4 parts:

- If both models do NOT recognize the drawing as a penguin → you get part 1 of the flag.
- If both models DO recognize it as a penguin → you get part 2 of the flag.
- If model 1 recognizes, but model 2 does NOT → you get part 3 of the flag.
- If model 1 does NOT recognize, but model 2 does → you get part 4 of the flag.

Everyone in the team who drew by hand got 0 points :(((

How to solve:
- Collect sample penguin images (I asked Gemini to draw penguins for me).

Prompt: Create a cute, adorable, lovely, cheese-stick penguin pixel art, 128x128.

Gemini: Okay, here you go!

And Gemini (at that time, gemini-flash) generously gave 5 images (actually 100).

Load 5 images and process them with process_penguins.py to get JSON files in the output_json directory (containing the pixel colors of those images).

Use send_submissions.py to automatically POST to the server and get results:
